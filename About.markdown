 I'm a current CS student interested in technology, art, and game design. I've worked on a wide range of tech-related projects, ranging from game coding, to 3D modelling, to music production. All those projects are listed here, sorted by category.

This website was created by me as well, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is avaliable on [GitHub](https://github.com/JulianHeuser/JulianHeuser.github.io).
